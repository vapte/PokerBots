USER FEEDBACK - 

1. Change Playback Lag input from integer to “developer” and “spectator modes”

2. I was having trouble with bots spending more than their stack (resulting in negative stack size). I thought it was an issue on my end, but a user suggested that it was an issue with the engine. He was right. 

3. Make diagrams to explain EvBasic and AfExploit (especially)



MY RESPONSES - 

1. Agreed. Done. 
2. Wrote a “player integrity” function that disallows raising/betting/calling more than the available stack.
3. Works in progress.
